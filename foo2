Doc?


All good here! Yes please!
function() {
  int x = 12;
  int y = 3
  int z = 145; // addded while rename
  return x + y;
}


Hi there this is a function() {
  int i = 0;
  char b = "x";

  if i > b {
    log("no such file")
  }

  return i + b;
}

And here we are again, all good it seems :D
Yes, still some goodness
